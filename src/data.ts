      description: `I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Ready Player Me, an Estonia-based startup offering a cross-game avatar platform.

As a lean startup, the company focused on being scrappy, rapidly building MVPs for various ideas and releasing them to test viability. In this context, I primarily worked as a product engineer, helping to create, launch, monitor, scale, and, in some cases, phase out our products and experiments.

Key responsibilities in my role included:

- Developing a monetization platform to help companies sell and manage their in-game assets.
- Building new features and improving our Avatar SDK for web, as well as enhancing the developer back office for easier integration.
- Maintaining and creating new features in our public API for developers.
- Contributing to the launch of the Ready Player Me gaming platform experiment.
- Implementing and launching PlayerZero, an avatar collectible platform, and continuously adding social features and a rewards system to drive user engagement.

I was part of the End-User App team, responsible for capturing photos and videos, providing real-time feedback to users, and integrating with client web flows via our SDK.

My role involved:

- Migrating the legacy web app and backend originally built with Aurelia and older Node.js code, to a modern stack using React and TypeScript on the front end and a new TypeScript-based backend.
- Building and improving communication between our data-gathering layer (images, audio, video) and our AI processing layer.
- Enhancing the end-user flow by introducing innovative features to improve usability, boost conversion rates, and help the product stand out from the competition.
- Making architectural decisions and driving improvements across the stack to ensure high availability and scalability.

My responsibilities ranged from adding new features to the platform and participating in a full site redesign, to improving both talent and client experiences through better UI, UX, and performance. Over time, my focus shifted toward internal architecture and core system improvements, including the implementation of an event-based architecture and breaking down the original monolith into microservices.

I also contributed to major UI improvements, including a full product redesign and the development of a custom React component library.
